# Libraries.io Extension

Quickly get all the information you need on a library right from your browser.

This browser extension kicks into action when you visit a known package manager or source code repository website, goes off to the [Libraries.io](https://libraries.io) API and gets all the relevant information on that library for you in a consistent format.

For source code repositories like GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket it also finds which package managers the repository you're viewing can be downloaded from.
